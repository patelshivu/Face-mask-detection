# Face-mask-detection
Dedicated to COVID-19

In these tough COVID-19 times, wouldn’t it be satisfying to do something related to it? I decided to build a very simple and basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow with Keras library and OpenCV to detect if you are wearing a face mask to protect yourself. 

Introduction: For building this model, I will be using the face mask dataset. It consists of about 1,376 images with 690 images containing people with face masks and 686 images containing people without face masks. We are going to use these images to build a CNN model using TensorFlow to detect if you are wearing a face mask by using the webcam of your PC. Additionally, you can also use your phone’s camera to do the same! 

I created the Flask web APP to detect the mask. you can simply download the model that i trained before. and Predict the mask which is wear or not.
